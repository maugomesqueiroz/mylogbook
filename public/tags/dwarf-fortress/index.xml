      <description>Dwarf Fortress I&amp;rsquo;ve lately been caught up in playing Dwarf Fortress with my brother. The game is a single-player simulation where you control a dwarven outpost in a randomly generated world 1.
It&amp;rsquo;s a rough game, really challenging. Nonetheless, fun. The way we would play it is one of us would open the Dwarf Fortress Wiki 2 and feed the other, who&amp;rsquo;s actually controlling the game, informations about it&amp;rsquo;s world.</description>
