This is a talk I gave in 2021 on how to learn Data Science effectively.

### First Steps

## Define Your Objective

If you are here, you should have by now envisioned where you want to get as a data scientist. It's OK, don't be shy. Put it on paper, I say.
Studies have shown that you get a special kick when you do it [^1].

In case you're wondering if your objective is good enough, try and see if it's SMART. And by SMART, i mean:

S > Specific

M > Measurable

A > Attainable

R > Relevant

T > Time Bounded 


## Goal 

No matter what objective you defined, I'm pretty sure an awesome goal if you're looking to be a data scientist is to *build a portfolio*.

A portfolio would be a public evidence of your skills as a Data Scientist[^2] and interviewers realy look at it. If you don't have any experience to show for, this is your shot to prove that you can do the job. Besides, you can do it while learning as some of the courses available online have a project as part of the syllabus.

It is also a good way to keep track of the projects that you've developed, so make sure to keep it clean!
